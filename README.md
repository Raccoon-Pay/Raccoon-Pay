# Raccoon Pay

Raccoon is a SMS based app that helps you easily figure out how much money you need to collect or pay during an event when you or other friends are making payments for everyone.

To get started, enter your number on our website or send "new" to (949) 835-5182, and a group will be made for you and other friends to join. When a member is making a payment for everyone, this member could simply text the amount of payment to us and thus the transaction will be tracked. At the end of the event, by triggering a check-out request calculations will be done by our system and each of group members will receive a final bill including how much this person needs to pay to each of other members.

Going dutch is made easy with Raccoon. We hope you enjoy our service!
